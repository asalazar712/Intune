# Intune Managed Device script samples

This repository of PowerShell sample scripts show how to retrieve, create, delete, and modify Intune service resources using cmdlets from the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.

Documentation for Intune and Microsoft Graph can be found here [Intune Graph Documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/resources/intune_graph_overview).

Documentation for the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK can be found here [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started?view=graph-powershell-1.0).

#### Disclaimer
Some script samples retrieve information from your Intune tenant, and others create, delete or update data in your Intune tenant.  Understand the impact of each sample script prior to running it; samples should be run using a non-production or "test" tenant account. 

Within this section there are the following scripts with the explanation of usage.

### 1. Get_DeviceAction_Set.ps1
This script scans the installed Graph PowerShell SDK for available remote actions based on specified Graph version and asks the user for a remote action to return the parameters for.

There are the following functions used:


#### Get-IntuneRemoteActions - Function
This function is used to return available remote actions from the Graph PowerShell SDK. It supports paramater -MgProfile to specify a Graph version.
```PowerShell
# Returns all Graph PowerShell SDK remote actions for the specified Graph beta version
Get-IntuneRemoteActions -MgProfile beta

# Returns all Graph PowerShell SDK remote actions for the specified Graph v1.0 version
Get-IntuneRemoteActions -MgProfile "v1.0"

# Returns all Graph PowerShell SDK remote actions for Graph v1.0 and beta version
Get-IntuneRemoteActions
```

### 2. ManagedDeviceOverview_Get.ps1
